# Github-Gitlab Mirroring
### 🚀 Project: GitHub–GitLab Mirror

I’ve created a GitHub–GitLab Mirror repository to maintain the same project codebase across both platforms — GitHub and GitLab.

### This setup helps in:

🔄 Automatic synchronization of commits between GitHub and GitLab.

💾 Backup and redundancy, so the code is safely stored on two platforms.


🌐 Open collaboration — contributors can use either GitHub or GitLab.

### The repository includes:

1) README.md → Project documentation and setup guide.

2) index.html → Sample file to verify successful mirroring.

By maintaining a mirrored repository, I can easily push updates to one platform and have them automatically reflected on the other — ensuring smooth collaboration and version control between both ecosystems.
